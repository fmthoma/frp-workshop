Game Over
================================================================================

The final missing piece (of game logic) in our Snake implementation is the
challenge of not losing the game: Don't run into yourself or the walls.

Exercise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the snake's head touches the wall or the snake itself, the game is over:
* The snake body becomes red.
* The snake stops moving.
